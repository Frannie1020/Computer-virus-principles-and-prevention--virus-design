# Computer virus principles and prevention-virus design
 
ðŸ’¡The functions that this virus can perform are as follows:  
1) Deletes files of a specific type in a specified directory (in the text, files of type .pptx, .xlsx)  
2) create a junk file in the specified directory  
3) modify the contents of a .c file in the specified directory (i.e. overwrite the contents of a .c file in the specified directory with the contents of a specific .c file)  
4) Generate a specific .exe junk file in the specified directory  

ðŸ’¡Results show

1: Before running, create 1.xlsx, 2.pptx and helloworld.c files in the virus_test folder. Then create a virus file, virus_create.c, which is infected with helloworld.c. The original contents of the helloworld.c and virus_create.c files are as follows

2: Open virus.cpp, compile and run, you will find the virus.exe file generated, double click on the virus.exe, you can find in the virus_test folder, has deleted all the .xlsx, .pptx files

3: Open the virus_test folder, the following screen appears, where 1.xlsx,2.pptx has been deleted, then there is also a junk file XXXa07012 and two virus programs worm1/worm2.exe

4: If you open the helloworld.c file, you will find that the contents become the contents of virus_create.c. This means that helloword.c is infected by the virus_create.c file.
